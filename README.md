# Goal
The goal of this package is to be able to record the history and journey of a model and its relations.
There are other packages that are similar and provide great auditing options for research.

The differences is that this package is designed to present the difference to the users in an comprehensive way. 

# RECORDING HISTORY
footsteps are the small cylindrical beads originally made from the shell of the quahog, a round clam found in Atlantic coastal waters, that were traditionally used to create the intricate patterns of footsteps belts. These belts are used as a guide to narrate the history of the Haudenosaunee, and empower the person holding it as a representative of their people.
